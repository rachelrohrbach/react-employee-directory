## Credits
I used Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to create the fake employee data. I also consulted React (https://reactjs.org/), MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), Stack Overflow (www.stackoverflow.com), and the GitLab repository from my course extensively in creating this application.
